"""
Replace the following constants with your own values where:
- RECEIVER_EMAIL: the email address of the receiver of the email
- CC_EMAIL_1: the email addresses of the CCs of the email. Note that the email addresses must be separated by a semicolon and a space (e.g. "email_1; email_2")
- SUBJECT: the subject of the email
- MESSAGE: the body of the email. Note that if you want to add a new line, you may need to use the \n command
- ATTACHMENT_1: the path of the thesis
- ATTACHMENT_2: the path of the thesis declaration form
- ATTACHMENT_3: the path of the notice of submission form
- BUTTON_SHRINK_FACTOR: the factor by which the button is shrunk. (currently set to 3, but depending on the size of your screen, you may need to change this value to 1, 2 or 4)
- AFTER_SUBMITTING_LINK: the link of the image that is displayed after the button is clicked.

Could be a good idea to test the script by setting the receiver email and cc emails to your own email address
